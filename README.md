* [ ] Using your [index.js file](js/index.js), create 10 [unique event listeners](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events). using your creativity to make the Fun Bus site more interactive.  Here are some unique events you could try to use: 
	* [ ] `mouseover`
	* [ ] `keydown`
	* [ ] `wheel`
	* [ ] `drag / drop`
	* [ ] `load`
	* [ ] `focus`
	* [ ] `resize`
	* [ ] `scroll`
	* [ ] `select`
	* [ ] `dblclick`

Using the 10 unique events, find ways to update the DOM in creative ways. For example you could change colors, animate objects, remove objects, etc.
